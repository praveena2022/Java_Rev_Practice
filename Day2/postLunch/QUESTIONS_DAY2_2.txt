1. Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array and print them on screen.
 
2. Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Again ask user to give a number. Now, tell user whether that number is present in array or not.
 
3. Take 20 integer inputs from user and print the following:
number of positive numbers
number of negative numbers
number of odd numbers
number of even numbers
number of 0s.
 
4. Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Now, copy all the elements in an another array but in reverse order.
 
5. Write a program to find the sum and product of all elements of an array.
 
6. Initialize and print all elements of a 2D array.
 
7. Find largest and smallest elements of an array.
 
8. Consider an integer array, the number of elements in which is determined by the user. The elements are also taken as input from the user. Write a program to find those pair of elements that has the maximum and minimum difference among all element pairs.
HINT : 
maximum difference = higest-lowest
minimum difference = second lowest - lowest
 
9. Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sort an array of integers in ascending order. One of the algorithm is selection sort. Use below explanation of selection sort to do this.
INITIAL ARRAY :
2	3	1	45	15
First iteration : Compare every element after first element with first element and if it is larger then swap. In first iteration, 2 is larger than 1. So, swap it.
1	3	2	45	15
Second iteration : Compare every element after second element with second element and if it is larger then swap. In second iteration, 3 is larger than 2. So, swap it.
1	2	3	45	15
Third iteration : Nothing will swap as 3 is smaller than every element after it.
1	2	3	45	15
Fourth iteration : Compare every element after fourth element with fourth element and if it is larger then swap. In fourth iteration, 45 is larger than 15. So, swap it.
1	2	3	15	45
